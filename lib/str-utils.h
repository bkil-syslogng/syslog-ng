 * DO NOT USE THIS MACRO UNLESS STRICTLY NECESSARY FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS.
 *
 * This macro tries hard to zero-terminate the string without moving it to a
 * new buffer.
 *
 * It is expected to be used at sites where the length is known and where
 * the input string is expected to be properly NUL terminated but not always.
 *
 * The macro checks if the string is indeed NUL terminated and if it is it
 * just assigns the original pointer to dest.  If it's not, it allocates a
 * new string via g_alloca() so it is automatically freed when the current
 * scope exits.
 *
 * This does not work as an inline function as we use g_alloca() and that
 * would be freed when the inline function exits (e.g.  when it is in fact
 * not inlined).
